# Mares Popa

## Hi, Iâ€™m Mares!

I'm a frontend engineer with in-depth experience in UI/UX development. In a nutshell, I create websites and web applications that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. My expertise lies within front-end web apps, and I've been working with a lot of frameworks and languages, including Next.JS, Typescript, React, AngularJS, Sass, Tailwind CSS and many others.

I live in Romania, married to a wonderful wife and been alive since 93'. Beside being obsessed with the web, I also enjoy cycling, basketball and visiting new cities.
