# Vanilla JavaScript: The Foundation of Web Development

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide range of web development tasks. From adding interactivity to your web pages to building complex web applications, JavaScript is an essential tool in every web developer's toolkit. However, with so many JavaScript frameworks and libraries available today, it can be tempting to jump straight into learning a particular framework like React, Angular, or Next.js.

As a frontend developer, I've seen many aspiring developers jump straight into learning JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular without first mastering the basics of vanilla JavaScript. In my experience, this approach can lead to frustration, confusion, and an incomplete understanding of how JavaScript works.

Before diving into the world of JavaScript frameworks, it's important to have a solid understanding of Vanilla JavaScript. Vanilla JavaScript refers to the core JavaScript language, without any external libraries or frameworks. By learning Vanilla JavaScript, you'll gain a deep understanding of the language's fundamentals, which will make it easier for you to learn and master any JavaScript framework or library.
First and foremost, vanilla JavaScript is the foundation upon which all JavaScript frameworks are built. By learning the basics of vanilla JavaScript, you'll have a better understanding of how these frameworks work and be better equipped to troubleshoot issues when they arise.

In addition, mastering vanilla JavaScript will give you a more complete understanding of the language itself, which will enable you to write cleaner, more efficient code. You'll also be better able to customize and extend existing code, rather than relying solely on pre-built solutions.

So where should you start with learning vanilla JavaScript? My recommendation is to start with the basics, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. Once you have a solid grasp of these concepts, you can move on to more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous programming.

There are many resources available for learning vanilla JavaScript, including online courses, tutorials, and books. Some of my personal favorites include the Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript Guide, the book "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke, and the online courses on Codecademy.

In conclusion, I believe that learning vanilla JavaScript should be your first priority as a frontend developer. By mastering the basics of the language, you'll be better equipped to understand and work with JavaScript frameworks, write cleaner and more efficient code, and ultimately become a more skilled and effective developer.
